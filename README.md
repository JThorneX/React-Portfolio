# React Portfolio

Currently: Looking for a full-time, remote job.

## Description

A portfolio showcasing my React and CSS skills as well as a selection of the work I've done over the past few months.

## Usage

[The pages](https://jthornex.github.io/React-Portfolio/) link to view.

Otherwise, npm i to install dependencies then npm start to start server and view in browser on localhost.

## Credits

[For the Experience Skill Bars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-skills)

[For Particles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles)

### To Work On

- ~~Responsiveness~~
- Header (undecided)
- ~~Timeline on experience page~~
- ~~Auto scroll the page up when using the nav to change pages~~
- Light/Dark mode toggle (probably not, I like the dark too much)

### Known Bugs

- ~~Text on skill bars not cyan~~
- ~~Home and About not selectable from nav on experience page~~
- ~~Footer overlapping body content when window is shortened~~
